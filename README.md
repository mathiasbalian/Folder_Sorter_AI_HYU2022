## Goal of the project
  Have you ever had a folder somewhere in your pc that was a total mess, completely filled with unsorted files of all types and subjects ? You realized too latethat it was a mess, and once you saw it, you quickly discovered that it would take you ages to sort this folder to make it look somewhat clean and tidy. Well, you can now say goodbye to this horrible unsorted folder, and use our brand new tool: Folder Sorter.
  Folder Sorter is an AI tool that will read the content of all your files* in the designated folder, analyse it and proceed to sort the files into folders corresponding to the categories of the files, for example administrative, school-related content (science, litterature, economics...), contracts etc.
   The tool would first have to undergo a phase of machine learning in order to gain in precision and to keep improving in categorizing files. We will use some word databases for various categories (words related to studies, school subjects, administrative papers...) in order to decide the content subject of a file and give the AI the ability to categorize a large range of files.
   
*The content of your files will never be leaked or used for other purposes than sorting your folder.

## I_Introduction
  Why are you doing this ?
    Have you ever had a folder somewhere in your pc that was a total mess, completely filled with unsorted files of all types and subjects ? You realized too late that it was a mess, and once you saw it, you quickly discovered that it would take you ages to sort this folder to make it look somewhat clean and tidy. We've often been confronted to this situation, and especially for school-related contents where every file is called 'Assignment 1', 'Assignment 2', etc, without precising the corresponding subject. It is enough to forget just one time put a file in the right folder, and then we lose an immense time opening it to see what it is about. And after accumulating a large amount of unsorted file, we just never clean up our folders. We wanted to change that with Folder Sorter !
  What do you want to see at the end ?
