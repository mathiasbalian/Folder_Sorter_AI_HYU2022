## Goal of the project
  Have you ever had a folder somewhere in your pc that was a total mess, completely filled with unsorted files of all types and subjects ? You realized too latethat it was a mess, and once you saw it, you quickly discovered that it would take you ages to sort this folder to make it look somewhat clean and tidy. Well, you can now say goodbye to this horrible unsorted folder, and use our brand new tool: Folder Sorter.
  Folder Sorter is an AI tool that will read the content of all your files* in the designated folder, analyse it and proceed to sort the files into folders corresponding to the categories of the files, for example administrative, school-related content (science, litterature, economics...), contracts etc.
   The tool would first have to undergo a phase of machine learning in order to gain in precision and to keep improving in categorizing files. We will use some word databases in order to decide the category of a file and give the AI the ability to categorize a large range of files.

* The content of your files will never be leaked or used for other purposes than sorting your folder.
